**Option A: Answer the questions below**

**Option B: Import from your existing AI**

Paste this into ChatGPT, Claude, or your current AI assistant:

```
I'm setting up a new AI assistant and want to define where it can help me most.

Based on our conversations, help me identify:

1. **High-Value Tasks:** What do I frequently ask for help with?
   - What tasks come up again and again?
   - Where do I get the most value from AI assistance?

2. **Time Sinks:** Where do I lose time that AI could save?
   - Repetitive work I complain about
   - Things I procrastinate on

3. **Blind Spots:** Where might I need proactive support?
   - Things I forget to do
   - Areas where I need reminding or accountability

4. **Stress Points:** What keeps me up at night?
   - Recurring worries or frustrations
   - Problems that don't seem to get solved

5. **Growth Goals:** Where do I want to improve?
   - Skills I'm developing
   - Habits I'm trying to build

Be specific. Examples help.

Format as a structured list I can paste into my new system.
