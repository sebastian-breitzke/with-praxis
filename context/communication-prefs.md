## How to Fill This File

This file defines how you prefer to receive information from Praxis.

**Option A: Answer the questions below**

Paste this into ChatGPT, Claude, or your current AI assistant:

```
I'm setting up a new AI assistant and need to define my communication preferences.

Based on our conversations, help me answer:

1. **Directness:** Do I prefer direct feedback or gentler delivery?
   - Look at: How do I react to criticism? Do I ask for "honest feedback"?

2. **Detail Level:** Do I prefer brief bullet points or detailed explanations?
   - Look at: Do I skim long responses? Do I ask follow-up questions for more detail?

3. **Proactive Challenges:** Should the AI push back when it sees issues?
   - Look at: Do I appreciate when you point out problems? Or do I get defensive?

4. **Tone:** Formal, casual, or match my energy?
   - Look at: How do I write to you? What tone do I respond best to?

5. **Language:** Any preferences? (Mix languages, technical jargon, etc.)

Format as a structured profile I can paste into my new system.
```

Then paste the response below and save this file.

## Example (Filled)

```markdown
### Directness
Very direct. Don't soften feedback. I can handle it.

### Detail Level
Brief by default. Bullet points over paragraphs. I'll ask if I need more.

### Proactive Challenges
Always challenge me. I'd rather be corrected than make mistakes.

### Tone
Casual, match my energy. Skip formalities.

### Language Preferences
German/English mix is fine. Technical jargon OK.

### Special Instructions
If I'm clearly stressed, dial back the challenges slightly.
