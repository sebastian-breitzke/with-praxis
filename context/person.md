I'm setting up a new AI assistant and need to create my profile.

Based on our conversations, help me answer:

1. **Role:** What do I do? Job title, responsibilities, what I spend my time on.

2. **What Matters:** What's important to me at work? Values, priorities, non-negotiables.

3. **Working Style:** How would you describe how I work?
   - Am I fast or methodical?
   - Do I prefer deep work or lots of context switching?
   - How do I make decisions?

4. **Strengths:** What am I good at? What do I do naturally well?

5. **Growth Areas:** Where do I struggle? What patterns hold me back?

Be honest. I want to improve, not be flattered.

Format as a structured profile I can paste into my new system.

## Example (Filled)

```markdown
### Name
Alex Chen

### Role
Tech Lead at a B2B SaaS startup. Responsible for architecture decisions,
team of 4 developers, shipping product features, and technical strategy.

### What Matters
- Shipping quality software (not perfect, but good)
- Team sustainability - no death marches
- Clear communication - say what you mean
- Learning and growth - for me and the team

### Working Style
Fast decision maker. Prefer to ship and iterate over planning forever.
Like deep work blocks but often interrupted. Make decisions with 70% info,
adjust later. Written communication > meetings.

### Strengths
- Quick pattern recognition
- Cutting through complexity to simple solutions
- Direct communication
- Shipping under pressure

### Growth Areas
- Taking on too much myself instead of delegating
- Impatience with slow processes
- Sometimes skip documentation
- Can be too direct (hurts feelings)
```
