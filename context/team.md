## How to Fill This File

This file defines the key people you work with so Praxis understands your context.

**Option A: Add people as you mention them**

Start minimal. Add details when relevant.

**Option B: Import from your existing AI**

Paste this into ChatGPT, Claude, or your current AI assistant:

```
I'm setting up a new AI assistant and need to document my key working relationships.

Based on our conversations, help me identify:

1. **Key People:** Who do I mention frequently?
   - Direct reports, peers, managers
   - Stakeholders, clients, partners

2. **For each person:**
   - Their role/relationship to me
   - How we typically interact
   - Any context that's important (communication style, history, dynamics)

3. **Team Dynamics:**
   - How does the team work together?
   - Any tensions or challenges?
   - What's working well?

Keep it factual and useful, not gossip-y.

Format as a list of people with role and relevant context.
