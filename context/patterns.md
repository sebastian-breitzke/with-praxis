## How to Fill This File

This file defines behavioral patterns Praxis should recognize and challenge.

**Option A: Answer the questions below**

**Option B: Import from your existing AI**

Paste this into ChatGPT, Claude, or your current AI assistant:

```
I'm setting up a new AI assistant that should challenge my unhealthy patterns.

Based on our conversations, help me identify:

1. **Recurring Patterns:** What behaviors do you see me repeat?
   - Things I do that aren't sustainable
   - Habits that cause problems
   - Tendencies I complain about but keep doing

2. **Triggers:** What situations trigger these patterns?
   - When do I fall into these behaviors?
   - What's the context when it happens?

3. **Warning Signs:** How can you tell when I'm slipping into a pattern?
   - What do I say?
   - What behaviors show up?

4. **What Helps:** What's worked to break these patterns?
   - Questions that make me pause
   - Reframes that help
   - Actions that interrupt the pattern

Be direct. I need honest feedback, not gentle observations.

Format as a list of patterns with triggers, signs, and interventions.
```

Then paste the response below and save this file.

## Common Patterns (Examples)

### Firefighter Mode
**What it looks like:** Jumping in to solve problems instead of coaching others. "Let me just do this real quick."

**Triggers:** Urgent requests, seeing someone struggle, tight deadlines.

**Warning Signs:** "I'll just handle it", working in others' domains, being the bottleneck.

**Challenge Question:** "Who could learn to own this instead?"

**Breaking the Pattern:** Ask "What would help you solve this?" instead of solving it.

---

### Over-Commitment
**What it looks like:** Saying yes to everything. Calendar completely full. Working evenings/weekends.

**Triggers:** FOMO, wanting to help, not wanting to disappoint.

**Warning Signs:** "I can squeeze it in", no buffer time, constant context switching.

**Challenge Question:** "What would you need to drop to do this well?"

**Breaking the Pattern:** Default response: "Let me check my capacity and get back to you."

---

### Perfectionism
**What it looks like:** Endless polishing instead of shipping. "It's not ready yet."

**Triggers:** High-visibility work, fear of criticism, unclear "done" criteria.

**Warning Signs:** Multiple revision rounds, 80% done for weeks, "just one more thing".

**Challenge Question:** "Is this good enough to ship? What's the real risk?"

**Breaking the Pattern:** Set a ship date. Polish in v2.

---

### Scope Creep (Self-Inflicted)
**What it looks like:** Adding features mid-project. "While we're at it..."

**Triggers:** Good ideas during implementation, seeing adjacent problems.

**Warning Signs:** Requirements growing, timeline slipping, "small addition".

**Challenge Question:** "Is this in scope, or should it be a separate task?"

**Breaking the Pattern:** Write it down, add to backlog, stay focused.
